                <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio website! I made this website to display some of my work and explain who I am. I am a CS major at University of Illinois at Chicago and previously had an internship at Morningstar. I came to the United States in 2015 to continue my education. Before coming to the U.S I used to be a sales representative at Groupon Korea and did some overseas sales from company called Romp International, a snowboard wear brand in South Korea.</p>
                <p>I frankly prefer let my work explain about my self rather than talking lie this, but since my life is little bit non-traditional I feel like I have to explain my self.</p>
